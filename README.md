 # Description:     
This code will scan all your directory, sub directory and files inside your given location.  

You can perform any action you want to do  with any type of junk files. Actually this idea came to my mind when I have 5 folders containing thousands of folders having few .html , .mp4 and few junk files but I required only .html and mp4 files. I had to delete all junk files to save my occupied space.

Then I wrote this script which can scan all the directories and sub directories. It will delete all the junk files and only mp4 and html will be left to copy!    

# How To Use?
Download the index.php file and put it in your localhost xampp, wamp, ammps or any server you are using for running PHP. 

# For XAMPP Users
1. Goto htdocs, create a folder lets suppose htdocs/scanner. 
2. Put the file index.php inside scanner folder.
3. Create another folder inside htdocs/scanner/ named my_directory and put different files and sub directories inside that htdocs/scanner/my_directories.
4. Now open index.php and replace scan_directory("PATH_TO_YOUR_DIRECTORY"); with scan_directory("my_directory"); in the bottom of the code.
5. Now run the code by using link i.e http://localhost/scanner/ you will see your all junk files will be removed and only mp4 and html files will be left.

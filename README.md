You can perform any action you want to do with any type of junk files. Actually this idea came to my mind when I have 5 folders containing thousands of folders having few .html , .mp4 and few junk files but I required only .html and mp4 files. I had to delete all junk files to save my occupied space.    Then I wrote this script which can scan all the directories and sub directories. It will delete all the junk files and only mp4 and html will be left to copy!
